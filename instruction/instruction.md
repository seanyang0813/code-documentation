2. The initial query input screen will be shown. You can enter some query in 

![instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_16-07-13.png](instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_16-07-13.png)

3. Scroll down and click the insert variable button. This button will inject a placeholder for the variable into the code. As you can see the code is updated, indicating the placeholder. Be aware that you should avoid the placeholder in your normal code to not cause confusion

3. Click next and name the variable. Fill in each of the input fields to indicate their name. As you can see, the name of the variable is table name. Each variable has to have a non empty name

4. Click next to reach the final step: documentation description. Provide a description for each of the variable and overall description. If you name multiple variables with the same name, they will share the same source during insertion and the description. The inputs for the queries on the top cannot be modified, press previous if you would like to make an edit. All of the variables are color coded so it's easier to see

![instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_16-15-23.png](instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_16-15-23.png)

5. After verifying all information is correct, click submit to submit the query to be saved.

## Viewing and editing in the library

After the previous step, you will see the query appear in the library. You can click the query to delete or modify the query.

## Delete and edit

Click on the query and a panel will show up. It's pretty much like the creation one but instead of making a new one, it modifies the query. This is the initial editing screen. Everything is pretty much the same as making a new query, but you just modify the existing components and be careful about editing what is inside the input placeholder

![instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_17-39-25.png](instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_17-39-25.png)

## delete

Scrolling down the first edit screen, you can find a delete button right below "insert variable". If you click it and confirm, it will be deleted

![instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_17-42-27.png](instruction%20menu%2011179a6ac2724977bd4666c66b653b91/Screenshot_from_2020-08-09_17-42-27.png)

## The search feature

By typing into the search box you can find your queries with string that matches the search. The check box indicates if you would like to show match with description and query.
